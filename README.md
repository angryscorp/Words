# Code challenge

The Test assignment is fully implemented and with the mentioned time limits.

The architecture of the application is based on the ideas of `Clean Architecture` and the `SOLID` principles. All layers are strongly separated and placed in different scopes, the interaction layer with the main business logic is covered with unit-tests.
 
Splitting `View` and `ViewController` as well as `Localization` weren't implemented because of restricted time, and it's the first thing to be improved.
